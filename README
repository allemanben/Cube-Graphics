Code uploaded for current state of project.

Step 1- create the 24 verticies for each cube (each vertex should have 2 identical others)
  Ordering of verticies: positve X face, positive Y face,
    positive Z face, Negative X face, negative Y face, negative Z face.

Step 2 set up colouring for each cube 
  -unless you find an easier way to do this, this will be a lot of hard coding...
  -non-coloured sides will be black (ie [0f, 0f, 0f, 1f])

Step 3 figure out drawing them in place.

Step 4 figure out movement (flight pattern) of "chickens"
